My DJI project took me a while to finish because I kept running into problems after problems. Most of it were which website were scrapable or not. I Tried at least 3 sites to see if they are scrapable or not. DJI is the best one I found so far since I wanted my project to be different than everybody else's. Then it was about what CSS selectors  I had to scrape to get the data I wanted to how to output the daya when the user(you) type a specific command . That also took me a while because most developers say that Ruby is easy, but for me it's pretty ahrd to understand. But I'm learning as I go along and that's all that matters.

My project basically ask the user(you) ti type specific command, and if that specific command is not entered it will show and error and tells you to try again. If that command is correctly entered, it will show you all the devices that it has with an index number next to it. 

After, if the user(you) are interested in a product or are familiar with a product and want to buy it but you don't know the price, you look for the number on the left and enter it and it will show the device name and how much it cost with discounted price.
