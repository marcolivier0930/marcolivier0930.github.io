Looping is when you want to repeat something in your code. Developers ususally use Loops in their function. The first time I saw a loop, the name tells me basically everything that it does. It just repeats the same piece of given code over and over again until the developer wants it to stop. So, it was pretty easy to understand the first time. But as I dove deep into it, the functions got more comoliacted and when I saw a loop, I know it ws repeating a piece of code. But it was hard for me to track.

There are many loops in many CS languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby and PHP. They all do basically the same thing.
