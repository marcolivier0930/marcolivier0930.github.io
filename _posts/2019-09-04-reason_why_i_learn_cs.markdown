I wanted to learn Software engineer because I was passionate about it ever since I saw Iron Man. I wanted to make my own JARVIS. Create cool techs that, I hope , one day would impact the world. I have a lot of idea in my head of what I want to create and I need the skills to start as soon as possible.
